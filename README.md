# Organic Synthesis Lab Protocols

This repository serves as the central "lab notebook" for established organic synthesis procedures. It is a shared, version-controlled library of reliable protocols for the research group.

## Purpose

- Maintain a collection of optimized synthetic procedures
- Enable collaborative documentation and review
- Track changes and improvements over time
- Provide a resource for training new group members

## Structure

- `/protocols/` – contains individual synthesis protocol files
- `TEMPLATE.md` – outlines the required format for all submissions

## Contributing

1. Create an issue describing the protocol you wish to add or modify.
2. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
3. Follow the template format in `/protocols/TEMPLATE.md`.
4. Submit a pull request for review.
5. After approval, your protocol will be merged into the main library.
